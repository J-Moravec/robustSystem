Description: Base system2 enable to catch either exit code, stdout or stderr.
    Or both stdout and stderr output combined. In some situation, you
    would like to catch stderr or exit code and based on that process or
    not process stdout at all. This is solved by robust_system, which catch exit
    code, stdout and stderr independently and return them in list.
